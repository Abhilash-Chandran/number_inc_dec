## [0.7.0] - 19June2021

* `autovalidate` has been replaced with `autovalidateMode`.  More details in TextFormField [docs]([TextFormField class - material library - Dart API](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextFormField-class.html))
   
   * In your code replace `autovalidate: true` to `autovalidateMode: AutovalidateMode.always` 
   
   * In your code replace `autovalidate: false` to `autovalidateMode: AutovalidateMode.disabled`

* `autovalidateMode` is by default set to `always`. The morale behind this is to perform validations similar to html's `<input type='number'>` tag kind validation performed in chrome. Its not upto the specification but ateleast mimics to its best.

* New attribute `enableMinMaxClamping` is created to and handles the behaviour of clamping the values to `min` and `max` when provided.  For example if `min` is -2 and user enter -5 this is autocorrected to -2. By default this is attribute is set to `true`.

* New attribute `onChanged` is introduced which when provided will be called whenever the user edits the value. Note this callback will not be called if any validation error exists.

* By default the numbers will be validated for stepped increments like in browser and suggest valid nearest possible values. The intention is to mimic the behaviour of number field in Chrome.

* Fixes the following bugs.
